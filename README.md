Cmd gives us command/flag handling similar to that of the Go tools themselves.  This is
no more than a thin layer on top of `flag` from the standard library.

## Install

for Installation and usage of this library run the following.

>  `go get zro.io/cmd`

## Usage

The simplest way to see the usage of the library is to look at `example_test.go`
